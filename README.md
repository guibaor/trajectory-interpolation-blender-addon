Add-on done for the "Animation" subject as a part of the Multimedia Engineering Degree Program (Autumn Semester 2019/2020).

The aim of the tool is to interpolate an object's path (defined with position keyframes inside Blender).
Several interpolation methods are implemented: Lineal, Catmull-Rom and Hermite, with different extra options: keep velocity constant, set velocity value, add a random oscilation and control its frequence and amplitude.

The Add-On was created for Blender 2.8.0, but still works with more recent Blender versions, like 3.0.0.
